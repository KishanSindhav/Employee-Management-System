            What’s the deal with Deel?
            How we work has changed. In real-time, we can collaborate on Zoom, design new products, and 
            attend (virtual) events from anywhere in the world.
            
            The one big issue? Tools to hire and pay international teams haven't kept up. International 
            hiring can be messy. With confusing local laws, complicated taxes, and even hefty fines 
            (if you don't get it right).

            The year it all clicked
            Why does hiring an employee in another country still take months? How do you hire contractors without 
            unintentionally breaking local laws? And why isn't there a great tool for all this?
            
            <!-- <img src="photos\bgpic1.jpg" class="img1"> -->
            At Deel, we envision a worldwide workforce that isn’t limited by boundaries, but we needed to change some   
            hings to make this a reality. So we went back to the drawing board (our laptops) to tackle these problems 
            and create a tool to enable remote teams to grow.

            Making a worldwide workforce a reality
            By solving these issues, we quickly realized we could open thousands of virtual doors around the world. 
            Meaning more companies from more places could hire fantastic talent. And people from more regions could 
            get the jobs they wanted. Anyone in the world could finally work everywhere.
